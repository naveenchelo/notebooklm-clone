# ---- Build Stage ----
# Use a Node.js version compatible with your Angular dependencies
FROM node:22-alpine AS build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# --- Dependency Installation ---
# Copy ONLY the package.json files that actually exist.
# We copy them first to leverage Docker's layer caching.
COPY backend/package.json ./backend/
COPY backend/package-lock.json ./backend/
COPY frontend/package.json ./frontend/
COPY frontend/package-lock.json ./frontend/

# Install backend dependencies
RUN npm install --prefix backend

# Install frontend dependencies inside the 'frontend' directory
RUN npm install --prefix frontend

# --- Source Code Copy ---
# Now that dependencies are installed, copy the rest of the source code.
# The .dockerignore file will prevent local node_modules from being copied.
COPY . .

# --- Frontend Build ---
# Run the Angular build command from within the frontend directory.
RUN cd frontend && npm run build

# =========================================================
# !!! CRITICAL DEBUGGING STEP !!!
# This will show the 'dist' directory if the build was successful.

# ---- Final Stage ----
# Use a fresh, lean image for the final application
